# I would have added more robust verification to the input. At the least a more informative error handling and notification

# I would have liked time to style the card more throroughly

# If I had time to do number 5, in order to create a cache I would have created a state for receivedAreas an object with the newPostcode as a key and the returned areas as an array value. When the user entered a new query I would add conditional logic to the submitPostcode function that would check if the queried code appeared as a key and if so setAreas to the spread of the array value
